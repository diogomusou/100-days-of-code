# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Treehouse: finished github(GH) basics, freeCodeCamp(FCC): finished HTML5 and CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap, Gear up for Success and jQuery. Now starting the project "Tribute Page". 

**Thoughts:** Treehouse: I remembered how to use GH, which I wasn't using for a while, but it's still troublesome to keep it up-to-date. FCC: still easy, just refreshing my skills.

**Discoveries:** CSS: !important   jQuery: prop(),addClass(),appendTo(),clone()

### Day 2: April 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp(FCC): finished 80% of the project "Tribute Page" on Miyamoto Musashi. 

**Thoughts:** FCC: I forgot many things that I had learned last year, but it's comming back little by little. Thinking about the words and layout is the hardest part...

**Discoveries:** bootstrap: blockquote, figure
