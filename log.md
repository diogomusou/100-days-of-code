# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Treehouse: finished github(GH) basics, freeCodeCamp(FCC): finished HTML5 and CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap, Gear up for Success and jQuery. Now starting the project "Tribute Page". 

**Thoughts:** Treehouse: I remembered how to use GH, which I wasn't using for a while, but it's still troublesome to keep it up-to-date. FCC: still easy, just refreshing my skills.

**Discoveries:** CSS: !important   jQuery: prop(),addClass(),appendTo(),clone()

**Link to work:** [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/diogomusou/pen/PmPJaX)
